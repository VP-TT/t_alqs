ðŸ§ â€¯TALQS â€” Transformer Architecture for Legal Question Answering & Summarization

TALQS is a dual-model NLP system built entirely from scratch using PyTorch, designed for the Indian legal domain. It features two Transformer-based models:

ðŸ”¹â€¯A Legal Question Answering model that understands court judgments and generates abstractive answers to user questions

ðŸ”¹â€¯A Legal Summarization model that produces concise, meaningful summaries of lengthy judgments

No pre-trained models. No shortcuts. Just pure Transformers â€” built from the ground up to handle real-world legalÂ complexity.
